# Technical Architecture: Cursor AI Agent

## System Overview

The Cursor AI Agent is an AI-powered system that bridges ideation and implementation for software projects. It consists of two primary components:

1. **Idea Intake System**: Collects and refines project ideas into structured specifications
2. **Cursor Integration**: Converts specifications into working code implementations

The system creates a seamless workflow between Mistral and Cursor, allowing users to rapidly prototype ideas with minimal technical overhead.

- **Specification Builder**: Compiles gathered information into structured format

#### Data Flow:

1. User submits initial idea through CLI or web interface
2. Input is sent to Mistral with specialized prompts
3. System analyzes Mistral's response to identify missing information
4. Targeted questions are generated and presented to user
5. User responses are integrated into evolving specification
6. Process repeats until specification is complete
7. Final specification is stored as structured JSON

### 2. Cursor Integration

The Cursor Integration component converts specifications into working code by leveraging Cursor's code generation capabilities.

#### Key Components:

- **Specification Parser**: Processes JSON specifications into Cursor-compatible format
- **Implementation Planner**: Determines optimal approach for code generation
- **Cursor API Client**: Manages communication with Cursor
- **Code Organizer**: Structures generated code into proper project architecture
- **Error Handler**: Manages issues during code generation

#### Data Flow:

1. System receives completed specification from Idea Intake

## Workflow Sequences

### Idea to Specification

1. User initiates new project with natural language description
2. System sends initial prompt to Mistral API
3. Mistral processes input and generates structured response
4. System parses response and identifies information gaps
5. System generates targeted questions for user
6. User provides additional information
7. Steps 2-6 repeat until specification is complete
8. Final specification is saved to storage

### Specification to Implementation

1. System retrieves completed specification
2. Specification is formatted for Cursor consumption
3. System sends implementation request to Cursor
4. Cursor generates implementation code
5. System organizes code into project structure
6. System validates implementation
7. If errors occur, system routes them to Mistral for analysis
8. Mistral suggests corrections, which are applied
9. Steps 3-8 repeat until implementation is successful or maximum iterations reached
10. Final implementation is provided to user

## Error Handling

### Mistral API Errors

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff
- **Timeout**: Retry with simplified prompts
- **Content Filtering**: Parse response for filtering notices and adjust prompts
- **Malformed Responses**: Implement structured parsing with fallbacks

### Cursor API Errors

- **Generation Failures**: Route to Mistral for analysis and correction
- **Syntax Errors**: Automatically fix common issues
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolve through versioning rules
- **Implementation Gaps**: Identify missing components and regenerate

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Management**: Secure storage of Mistral and Cursor API keys
- **User Data**: Minimize storage of sensitive information
- **Code Generation**: Scan generated code for security vulnerabilities
- **Prompt Injection**: Validate and sanitize user input
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through request throttling

## Scalability Considerations

- **Stateless Design**: Main components operate statelessly for horizontal scaling
- **Queue System**: Process requests asynchronously during high load
- **Caching**: Cache common patterns and responses
- **API Rate Management**: Respect API limits through token bucket algorithms
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track resource usage for early scaling decisions

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify Mistral and Cursor integrations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate complete workflows
- **Prompt Testing**: Evaluate prompt effectiveness and consistency
- **Edge Cases**: Test system with unusual or complex inputs
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure continued functionality after changes

## Deployment Options

- **Local Development**: Run entirely on developer machine
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy as web service with API endpoints
- **Hybrid Model**: Local UI with cloud-based AI processing
- **Container Support**: Package as Docker container for portability
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

## Future Architecture Considerations

- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom integrations
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for additional models beyond Mistral
- **Collaboration Features**: Multi-user support with role-based access
- **Learning System**: Improve responses based on user feedback
- **Specialized Domains**: Domain-specific modules for different project types
