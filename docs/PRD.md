# Product Requirements Document: Cursor AI Agent

## Product Overview
Cursor AI Agent is an end-to-end creative collaboration tool that bridges ideation and implementation. It leverages Mistral for ideation and Cursor for code implementation, creating a seamless workflow that transforms rough ideas into functional prototypes with minimal human intervention.

## Problem Statement
Developers and creators spend significant time translating conceptual ideas into working prototypes. This process is fragmented, requiring constant context switching between ideation tools and development environments. Cursor AI Agent eliminates this friction, allowing users to focus on big-picture vision while the AI handles implementation details.

## Target Users
- Software developers seeking to accelerate prototyping
- Product managers needing to quickly validate concepts
- Technical founders with limited development resources
- Developers learning new frameworks or technologies

## Key Features

### 1. Idea Intake System
- **Natural Language Input**: Accept rough ideas in plain English
- **Structured Ideation**: Transform vague concepts into actionable specifications
- **Contextual Questions**: Automatically identify and ask for missing information
- **Scope Definition**: Help users define clear boundaries for the prototype

### 2. Mistral Integration for Ideation
- **API Connection**: Direct integration with Mistral's models
- **Specialized Prompting**: Custom prompts optimized for technical ideation
- **Structured Output**: Generate JSON-based specifications that Cursor can consume
- **Knowledge Enhancement**: Automatically research and add relevant technical details
- **Advanced Response Parsing**: Utilize regex and NLP techniques to accurately extract structured data from Mistral responses
- **Intelligent Error Recovery**: Automatically detect and resolve parsing issues through iterative refinement

### 3. Cursor Integration for Implementation
- **Code Generation**: Convert specifications into functioning code
- **Project Structure**: Create proper file hierarchy and configuration
- **Smart Dependencies**: Automatically identify and include necessary libraries
- **Implementation Patterns**: Use best practices for the target technology
- **Error Resolution System**: Automated troubleshooting and iteration when Cursor encounters issues
- **Self-Healing Implementation**: Route implementation errors back to Mistral for analysis and correction

### 4. Workflow Management
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor the status of each prototype component
- **Version Control**: Maintain history of changes across iterations
- **Feedback Loop**: Easy mechanism to refine implementations
- **Asset Management**: Track and organize resources needed for the prototype
- **Automated Iteration Pipeline**: Systematic process for routing issues between Mistral and Cursor
- **Implementation Analytics**: Track success rates and common failure patterns

### 5. User Interface
- **CLI Mode**: Command-line interface for developer-focused workflows
- **Web Interface**: Optional graphical interface for visual collaboration
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project state between sessions
- **Collaboration Features**: Share prototypes with team members

## Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
- Backend server (Python/Node.js) to manage communication between Mistral and Cursor
- State management system to track project specifications and implementation status
- API integrations for both Mistral and Cursor
- Local database for storing project details and history
- Natural Language Processing pipeline for response parsing
- Automated error handling and recovery system

### API Requirements
- Mistral API access with appropriate rate limits for production use
- Cursor extension APIs or command-line capabilities
- Optional: Cloud storage for project assets
- Error feedback loop between Mistral and Cursor
- Structured response validation and parsing

### Performance Requirements
- Response time under 2 seconds for ideation requests
- Code generation completed within 30 seconds for typical components
- Support for projects up to 50 files or 10,000 lines of code
- Maximum of 3 automated iteration attempts before human intervention
- 95% parsing accuracy for Mistral responses
- Error resolution success rate of 80% or higher

## User Flow

1. **Ideation Phase**
   - User inputs rough idea
   - System asks clarifying questions
   - Mistral generates structured specification
   - User reviews and approves specification

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - System converts specification to Cursor-compatible format
   - Cursor generates implementation code
   - System organizes code into project structure
   - Prototype is prepared for execution

3. **Refinement Phase**
   - User reviews prototype
   - Feedback is processed by Mistral
   - Specifications are updated
   - Implementation is regenerated with improvements
   - System automatically detects and resolves implementation issues
   - Mistral analyzes failures and proposes solutions
   - Automated iteration continues until success or human intervention needed

## Success Metrics
- Time saved per prototype (target: 70% reduction)
- Implementation accuracy (target: 80% of specifications correctly implemented)
- User satisfaction score (target: 8/10 or higher)
- Iteration efficiency (target: 50% faster than manual development)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional AI models beyond Mistral
- Support for visual design prototyping
- Automated testing of generated prototypes
- Deployment automation for completed projects
- Collaborative multi-user workflows
